Our name, JsGames, is short for JavaScript Games, although we use other languages such as HTML and CSS as well. As of now, we have had over 200,000 people play our games, each and every one of them giving a 5-star review. With just over a million plays, the game, Rock, Paper Scissors, is skyrocketing in the market. Right now, JsGames is hiring! All to develop even more cunning content and maintain our website. The current staff consits of Rick Gervais, Shivam Dave, John Doe, John Doe, John Doe, John Doe, John Doe, John Doe, John Doe, and you guessed it, John Doe!
