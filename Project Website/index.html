    <p class="intro">To the JsGames family. My name is Shivam, but you can call me Shiv. Here, at the JsGames family, we code in multiple languages. As the name suggests, we code games, although, we focus on coding websites as well. The languages we use consist of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. If you'd like to access some of the code form the top, right click on your screen, and select inspect. Our company has been running for just over half a century now, our staff, masters of their work. Now that you know a little about us, have fun exploring through the website! </p>
